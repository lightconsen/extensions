When scoring multiple times, your scores should be consistent for the same note content.

## Evaluation Criteria

The title should be controlled within 25 words, and it should be attractive, preferably with numbers, and should consider matching SEO keywords. It should also contain emoj elements that are unique to the Xiaohongshu platform, such as popular and hot emoj elements.

For example:

```

At the end of the main text, you need to @ some official accounts of related topics on Xiaohongshu, and you also need to add some topics related to the topic through #.
The call to action should be designed in combination with the pain points of the target users of this note, and some welfare data packages should be designed to attract them to comment. For example: "If the theme of the note is a fitness tutorial, the welfare bait may be some training plan PDFs. If the theme is a PS tutorial, the welfare bait can be a download link for PS tools."
For the pictures you write in the notes, you need to give me some suggestions and directions for the content of the pictures.
